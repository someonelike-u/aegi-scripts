# aegi-scripts

A list of Aegisub scripts for my own use (in French subs):

- `detectMissingPointsOrCapitalLetters.lua` Detect missing points or capital letters
- `detectSigns.lua` Detect some signs in subs and apply a .ass style  (for NF or AMZ)
- `no-pasted-dialogues` Detect dialogues pasted between them and separate them (like the French Crunchyroll timing)
